# Resources

Any communication/other traces should be placed in this folder.

A specific trace format is or file naming convention is not required. 

My proposal is as follows:
- For NFC, use words such as `request`/`response`, `outgoing`/`incoming`, or  arrows `-->`/`<--`, `>`/`<` to denote commands and responses.  
Use `#` or `*` for comments or other notes;
- Begin file name with communication type. Add lock owner name, lock model, and names of all known operations that happened during the communication.
